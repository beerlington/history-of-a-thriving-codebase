# Introduction

Reading this book is going to change how you think about software development. Not just you, but also the people you work with, those you don't even know you're going to work with, and the unfortunate ones you'll never meet, who will be forced to maintain your code.

History of a Thriving Code Base is not intended to be an introduction to Git, nor was it written specifically for experienced developers. It's also not a recipe book or a reference book. In essence, this book teaches you how to be a code historian. We'll explore some of the necessary basics of Git, but we'll also be focusing on things like best practices as well as some advanced features. By the time you're done with this book, you'll understand the value of a well recorded Code Base and be able to maintain one yourself.

How often do you look at a line of code, a method, or an entire file and wonder who would write such a disastrous mess, only to find out you had written it six months earlier? What about when you start to write a bit of functionality and discover you had already built it?

Why do we have such a difficult time remembering these things?

As software developers, we are constantly using our brain's short-term, "working" memory. Not just using it, but abusing it. Our lives are filled with distractions - everything from email to Twitter. Our working memory provides sharp detail about thing we are working on right now. It's like the RAM in your computer. It's fast, it's efficient, but has its limitations. This working memory lasts only about 20-30 seconds, but is incredibly efficient in helping us code.

Long-term memory, on the other hand, is always there but can sometimes be frustrating when we want to remember the specifics of an event even just days earlier. We know that the memory is there, we just have trouble retrieving it. Have you ever seen a photograph of an event from your distant past, and that one image of a split second moment brought back tons of other memories and associations? The history of our code works in a similar way. Chances are you won't remember why you wrote a specific piece of code in a few months. Not only that, but you may forget that the code even exists.

Our brains are not designed to remember boring things for very long. Traumatic events become engrained in our memories, but the ones that don't stand out are easily forgotten. Writing code is not exciting enough nor traumatic enough for us to recall it at a moment's notice. It's important to understand the limitations of how our brains work, so that we understand the immense value of a well recorded history.
